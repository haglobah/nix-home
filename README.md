# nix-home

This is my as simple as possible [home manager](https://home-manager.dev/) configuration.

It started out being decoupled from my NixOS config since I wasn't sure whether all of my systems would be on NixOS in the future.

Now I am decently sure that this is gonna be the case—and have therefore moved my home manager config into my NixOS configuration (as home manager modules, though).

You can find my NixOS config here: [haglobah/mynix](https://github.com/haglobah/mynix)
